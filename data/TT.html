			<p> An independent side project where users can monitor their both incoming and 
			outgoing transactions. </p>
	
			<p> This program, using SQLite, stores user information, user transactions, user 
			preferences, and program preferences. The database securely stores user password with 
			BCrypt and more information encryption to come. A user, through a text interface, can 
			create a new account, log in and out of their current account, check their current 
			balance, add new transactions, edit user and program settings, and soon will be able to
			see a breakdown of their transactions. Users can use Transactions Tracker to monitor their
			expenses and see how much they are spending in certain categories, at certain locations, 
			and much much more. Transactions Tracker allows users to become more fiscally responsible 
			and aware of where money is both coming in from and more importantly where it is going to.
