TO DO LIST: 

- Specification tests -- User (user name taken, user name/name/password too long, password too short)
						 Transactions (location/memo too long, invalid number for category, not logged in)
						 Main menu (invalid number, non-number input)
						 Settings (not logged in, category name too long, category already exists)

- Program options : show history

- Edit when I need to send info to log file and when I can't just alert user through text

- Lock out a user after a number of incorrect attempts to log in

- make the adding a transaction a DB transaction where I can roll back if need be.
	
- If SQLite DB is locked hold transaction information and add it when available.

- GUI (ability to go back at any point, remember me option to store user info to prevent repeated log ins)
